# angular-reusable-search-bar
search bar with configurations


- hopefully, I can do this in just angular
  - index info can be contact info, and can search by name or zipcode or address


- make a seperate branch where its updating the grid
  - maybe use ngxs to do that, otherwise you would need to @import @export ...


- in order to make it super configurable, you would have to set things like clear button to true when you call it and such.
